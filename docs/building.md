# Building
Sunshine binaries are built using [CMake](https://cmake.org) and requires `cmake` > 3.25.

## Building Locally

### Compiler
It is recommended to use one of the following compilers:

| Compiler    | Version |
|:------------|:--------|
| GCC         | 13+     |
| Clang       | 17+     |
| Apple Clang | 15+     |

### Dependencies

##### CUDA Toolkit
Sunshine requires CUDA Toolkit for NVFBC capture. There are two caveats to CUDA:

1. The version installed depends on the version of GCC.
2. The version of CUDA you use will determine compatibility with various GPU generations.
   At the time of writing, the recommended version to use is CUDA ~12.9.
   See [CUDA compatibility](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html) for more info.

> [!NOTE]
> To install older versions, select the appropriate run file based on your desired CUDA version and architecture
> according to [CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)


#### Windows
First you need to install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org), then startup "MSYS2 UCRT64" and execute the following
commands.

##### Update all packages
```bash
pacman -Syu
```

##### Install dependencies
```bash
dependencies=(
  "git"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-boost"  # Optional
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cppwinrt"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-curl-winssl"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-doxygen"  # Optional, for docs... better to install official Doxygen
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-graphviz"  # Optional, for docs
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-MinHook"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-miniupnpc"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-nodejs"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-onevpl"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-openssl"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-opus"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain"
  "mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-nlohmann_json"
)
pacman -S "${dependencies[@]}"
```

### Clone
Ensure [git](https://git-scm.com) is installed on your system, then clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo.git --recurse-submodules
cd Apollo
```

#### Fetch Missing Artifacts (v1.15.3 only)
If you are building version 1.15.3, some binary artifacts were omitted from the git index. You must manually fetch them from the master branch before building:

```bash
git checkout origin/master -- \
  src_assets/windows/drivers/sudovda/SudoVDA.dll \
  src_assets/windows/drivers/sudovda/nefconc.exe \
  src_assets/common/assets/web/package-lock.json

mkdir build
```

Manually
### Build

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -S .
ninja -C build
```

> [!TIP]
> Available build options can be found in
> [options.cmake](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/blob/master/cmake/prep/options.cmake).

### Package
You can do installer or portable.
#### Installer
```bash
cpack -G NSIS --config ./build/CPackConfig.cmake
```

#### Portable
```bash
cpack -G ZIP --config ./build/CPackConfig.cmake
```

### Remote Build
It may be beneficial to build remotely in some cases. This will enable easier building on different operating systems.

1. Fork the project
2. Activate workflows
3. Trigger the *CI* workflow manually
4. Download the artifacts/binaries from the workflow run summary
